## Description
A simple, mostly text-based application for creatives to organize their thoughts. Styled in such a way as to be reminiscent of bullet journaling. Name inspired by combining "writer" with "rider" (a performer's list of unique demands).

## <a name="userstories"></a> User Stories

* As a user, I want to have an account that allows me to save my created documents in as specific types (Journal, Mood Board, or Manuscript) so that my works are accessible.
* As a creative, I want a clean user interface (UI) that stylistically represents written forms of journaling to easily keep track of all created documents.
* As a user, I want to be able to view all documents of a specific type to make managing my documents more simple - whether that is finding, adding to, or deleting documents.
* As a creative, I want to be able to take notes as soon as I open the app, in order to capture my fleeting thoughts.
* As a modern human, I want a reliable application that performs as expected so that I can utilize it without delay and frustration.
* As an active user, I want to arrive at a read-only show page with edit (pencil icon), save (floppy icon), and delete (trashcan icon with confirmation) functionalities.
* As a user, I want to be able to log in to and out of my account so that if my devices were accessed by another, my documents would be secure.
